After getting and unpacking the distribution file, go to quenas directory and run at the shell:

$ make quenas

This will completely build an executable for your platform. Then, you are ready to run simulations.

You can first run the simulator in test mode to check that everything is in order:

$ quenas -test

Running a simulation is very easy; you just need to provide an input file (usually with sim extension),
and the name for an XML output file:

$ quenas example.sim ouput.xml

The output file can be seen with any text viewer or with a browser. The simulations can optionally
use XSLT templates to provide a nice view of the output.
